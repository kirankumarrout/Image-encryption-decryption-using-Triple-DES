#  Image Encryption  & Decryption Using Triple DES üíªüîêüèû

Mini project for encrypting/decrypting images through web app.

## Introduction
In this project I created a web application to encrypt/decrypt images using Triple DES algorithm.


Image encryption and decryption is a crucial aspect of digital security, especially in today's world where sensitive information is often transmitted and stored in visual formats. This project aims to develop a robust and efficient web application that leverages the [Triple DES (3DES)] encryption algorithm to securely protect images from unauthorized access.

Triple DES, a symmetric-key block cipher, offers a higher level of security compared to its predecessor, DES, by applying the DES algorithm three times with different keys. This multi-layered approach enhances the resistance to brute-force attacks and other cryptanalytic techniques.

By utilizing Triple DES, this web application provides a reliable solution for encrypting and decrypting images, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of visual data. The project's primary goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload, encrypt, decrypt, and download images, while maintaining the highest standards of security.
